# Business Denial Notification System

## üéØ Overview
This system automatically notifies business owners via email and in-app notifications when their business submissions are denied, including the specific reason for denial.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### Backend Implementation

1. **Enhanced Business Schema**
   - Added `rejection_reason` field to store detailed denial reasons
   - Added `rejected_at` and `rejected_by` fields for audit tracking
   - Added `denial_notification_sent` and `denial_notification_sent_at` for notification tracking
   - Added `approved_at` and `approved_by` fields for approval tracking

2. **Email Notification System**
   - **Business Approval Email**: Congratulatory email with next steps and dashboard link
   - **Business Denial Email**: Professional email with specific rejection reason, tips for improvement, and resubmission instructions
   - Both emails include helpful guidance and clear action items

3. **In-App Notification System**
   - Added `BUSINESS_APPROVED` and `BUSINESS_REJECTED` notification types
   - Notifications include business name and rejection reason
   - High priority notifications for both approval and rejection
   - Notifications are linked to the business for easy reference

4. **Enhanced Admin Service**
   - Updated `verifyBusiness()` method to send approval email and notification
   - Updated `rejectBusiness()` method to require reason and send denial notifications
